I am currently working on this, and i have already a number of solutions. It is nice to have a high quality site, that i can use also for my convenience. Because if you do not write these things down, you will eventually forget some parts. And i can also recommend writing some basic's down if you are starting any kind of new programming/design.

So if the float functions are causing problems there is a couple of options you can try.

One is modify the div alignment in the div tag it self like so <div class="kosher" align=left> If this does not suit you then there is another option with m
        </div>
